# Week2 - Introduction to Object Detection

The goal of this week is to get familiar with the Detectron2 framework by doing inference with different models in the MIT_split dataset, and fine tuning a Faster R-CNN on a modified KITTI dataset.

This training script can be used to train a baseline image classification model on any dataset that is organized as
